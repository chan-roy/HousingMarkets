# Introduction

During periods of severe economic and housing market instability such as the time of the Great Recession, policymakers are concerned with the potential of a significant increase in the number of mortgage defaults, wherein a mortgage agreement is broken most often caused by the mortgagor (borrower in a mortgage agreement) failing to make payments. Mortgage defaults directly lead to the process of foreclosures which create additional cost for lenders who attempt to recoup the cost of the property. However, it is not always clear what type of intervention is most appropriate and/or feasible to relieve this issue provided the likelihood of high strain on the economy during such times. 

In the paper \textit{Unemployment Insurance as a Housing Market Stabilizer} [@citeHsu], it is discussed that there exists a debate on the reasoning for mortgage defaults rendering it difficult to effectively design an intervening policy. Some mortgagors may choose to purposefully default on their mortgages, in the cases where the value of the debt significantly outweights the price of the property. Their paper focuses on the expansions of unemployment insurance and benefits during the Great Recession, and hypothesises that it resulted in a significant reduction of the number of foreclosures during that time, as well as dampening changes in housing prices as a result of labor market instability. In this paper, we will be replicating the analysis originally presented by [@citeHsu] as well as expanding on their analysis of housing price changes.

# Data
```{r loadData}
# read in csvs for each dataset
econ_analysis <- read_csv(here::here("inputs/data/econ_analysis.csv"))
sipp_analysis <- read_csv(here::here("inputs/data/sipp_analysis.csv"))
nlsy_analysis <- read_csv(here::here("inputs/data/nlsy_analysis.csv"))

```
We would like to investigate the relationship between changes in unemployment benefit generosity and the number of home foreclosures within the United States. The original analysis performed by [@citeHsu] is done in Stata. For the purposes of aiding reproducibility, we will be reproducing their scripts using `R` [@citeR], `dplyr` [@citeDplyr] and converting data filetypes with `haven` [@citeHaven]. Data is retrieved for presenting within this report using `here` [@citeHere]. Plots are created using `ggplot2` [@citeGgplot]. Tables are generated using `kableExtra` [@citeKable].

As a reproduction, we will be utilising the same data as the original paper, as made available and obtained from openICPSR [@citeData]. There are five separate datasets used within the paper:

- Attributes relating to unemployment benefits for each state for the years of 1991-2010, obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Labor, and Hirsch and Macpherson (2003).

- Factors of mortgage borrowers relating to potential of delinquency from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) years 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and supplemented by the corresponding unemployment insurance program characteristics obtained from the Department of Labor.

- Household data of mortgage borrowers from the NLSY79 survey years 2010 and 2012 for foreclosure related variables.

- Characteristics of mortgages and housing relating to foreclosure risk by state from NLSY79 2010 and 2012.

- Home price growth, unemployment rates, and unemployment insurance data of each state from 2008 to 2013, obtained from Zillow, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Department of Labor respectively.

The following table, Table \@ref(tab:summaryStats) is a reproduction of Table 1 from the original paper, showing summary statistics of the variables of interest for our analysis.

```{r summaryStats}

    pack_rows("Employment, income, and assets", 37, 39)
```


# Model
As we are primarily interested in how changes in unemployment benefits affect the number of mortgage defaults, a suitable model should encompass the relationship between these two factors. Thus, we will be using and replicating the results of model 2 in the original paper, which models the relationship between mortgage delinquency and unemployment benefits. An advantage of this model as compared to the others within the paper is that there exists a significant amount of variability between each state's unemployment benefits [@citeHsu], and so we want to account for economic differences between households by the inclusion of control variables. The model uses data from the SIPP years 1991-2010, and is as follows:

\begin{center}
$Delinquent_{is} = \alpha + \beta MaxEBEUC_s \times Layoff_i + \delta Layoff_i + \zeta X_i + \lambda_s + \epsilon_{is}$
\end{center}

$Layoff$ is a categorical variable for indicating if the respondent household has experienced a layoff, and thus eligible for unemployment benefits. It is interacted with $MaxEBEUC$, the product of the maximum amount of weekly unemployment benefits available comprised from extended benefits (EB) and emergency unemployment compensation (EUC), and the maximum number of weeks for which the benefits can be paid, $Layoff_i$ is the indicator of whether a layoff occurred within the household in prior 12 months, and $\zeta X_i, \lambda_s$ represent the control household and state variables respectively.

# Results
Firstly, we will replicate Figure 3 of the original paper, plotting mortgage delinquency against maximum unemployment benefits, to quickly visualise and validate that there is a relationship between them.

```{r plotModel, fig.cap="Correlation between change in mortgage delinquency and max benefit by state, for SIPP years 1991 and 2010", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
# calculate change in max benefit and change in mortgage delinquency percentage between the oldest and newest years of the SIPP
data_2010 <- sipp_analysis %>%
  filter(layoff == 1 & year == 2010) %>%
  select(year, stcode, delinq_mort, max_ben) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(stcode, year) %>%
  mutate(delinq_mort = sum(delinq_mort) / 100) %>%
  distinct()

data_1992 <- sipp_analysis %>%
  filter(layoff == 1 & year == 1992) %>%
  select(year, stcode, delinq_mort, max_ben) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(stcode, year) %>%
  mutate(delinq_mort = sum(delinq_mort) / 100) %>%
  distinct()
  
plot_data <- merge(data_2010, data_1992, by = "stcode") %>%
  summarise(stcode, change_ben = max_ben.x - max_ben.y, change_delinq = delinq_mort.x - delinq_mort.y)

plot_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = change_ben, y = change_delinq, label = stcode)) + 
  geom_text() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold')) +
  labs(x = "Change in Max Unemployment Benefit (%)", y = "Change in Mortgage Delinquency Rate (%)", title = "Negative correlation between mortgage delinquency \nand max unemployment benefits", caption="* Numbers correspond to U.S. FIPS codes for states")
```

As we can discern from the plot, there exists a negative correlation between unemployment benefits and mortgage delinquency, as increases in benefits reflect a decrease in delinquency. At this point, we perform our linear regression using the aforementioned model. There are three variations of the model discussed within the original paper, the first being as originally shown, the second as a cubic regression for the variable of $MaxEBEUC$, and the third focusing on weeks of benefit duration instead of compensation directly. As an expansion to investigate additional factors not originally addressed, we create a fourth model using net worth as an indicator. We show the results of these three regression models in Table \@ref(tab:modelTable).

```{r model, include=FALSE}
# models adapted from sipp_analysis.do 
model_1 <- lm(delinq_mort ~ max_ben_eb_euc_demeanX * layoff + unemp_rate + ln_realgdp_percap + wages_state + ui_rr + neg_ui_rr + union_cov, data = sipp_analysis)
summary(model_1)
model_2 <- lm(delinq_mort ~ max_ben_eb_euc_demeanX * layoff + tur_3mo_demeanX * layoff + unemp_rate + ln_realgdp_percap + wages_state + ui_rr + neg_ui_rr + union_cov, data = sipp_analysis)
summary(model_2)
model_3 <- lm(delinq_mort ~ eb_euc_weeks_demeanX * layoff + tur_3mo_demeanX * layoff + unemp_rate + ln_realgdp_percap + wages_state + ui_rr + neg_ui_rr + union_cov, data = sipp_analysis)
summary(model_3)
model_4 <- lm(delinq_mort ~ thhtnw * layoff + unemp_rate + ln_realgdp_percap + wages_state + ui_rr + neg_ui_rr + union_cov, data = sipp_analysis)
summary(model_4)
```

```{r modelTable}
model_stats <- data.frame(labels = c("Max EB EUC * Layoff", "Max EB EUC Duration * Layoff","Net worth * Layoff", "Layoff", "Observations", "$R^2$"), 
                          "1" = c("-0.246 (0.07)","", "", "10.2", "12,606", "0.03"),
                          "2" = c("-0.30 (0.07)","", "", "10.1", "12,606", "0.03"),
                          "3" = c("", "-0.33 (0.08)", "", "9.95", "12,606", "0.03"),
                          "4" = c("", "", "-14.7 (0.849)", "9.65", "12,606", "0.02"))

model_stats %>% 
  kbl(booktabs = T, col.names = c(" ", "1", "2", "3", "4"), caption="Summary of Linear Regression Results", escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Mortgage delinquency" = 4)) %>%
  footnote(general = "Standard error of estimates stated in brackets.")
```

Relative to the results obtained in the original paper, we are able to replicate similar results using the data and adapting the regression models from Stata to `R`. For all four variations, our estimated values are statistically significant at the $p(<0.05)$ level. Thus, we confer the result that for every $1000 increase in unemployment benefits, there is a corresponding -0.24% decrease in probability of mortgage delinquency. For model 4, we see a strong negative correlation between net worth and mortgage delinquency, with a -14.7% decrease in probability of delinquency per \$1 million in net worth.

# Discussion
## Limited effectiveness of unemployment insurance to prevent mortgage delinquency
Our analysis was able to determine a statistically significant decrease in mortgage delinquency, however the magnitude of the percentage probability change is small. We theorise that, as previously introduced, there exists a trend of strategic defaulting. During the period of the Great Recession, it is estimated that up to 17% of mortgages were strategically defaulted [@citeExperian], owing to falling property prices outweighing the debt of a defaulted mortgage. This is compounded by the use of indirect intervention- individuals may not be concerned with prioritising mortgage payments in times of economic hardship.

## Weaknesses and next steps
While this paper was successful in replicating aspects of the original paper, there are several weaknesses that limit its accuracy. As the original analysis was written and performed in Stata, I still have limited familiarity with the software, thus the code conversion to R may not have fully replicated original processes, with not all methods used in the original being available. With regards to the limitations of the data, the variable of house price growth was not made available, which required us to exclude it from our models. Weights were not applied for SIPP and NLSY analysis due to complications with applying different weights per year, resulting in summary statistics figures and model estimates differing slightly for both total number of observations and calculated variables. An expansion of the analysis performed in this paper would ideally utilise differing datasets. Given that the data is localized for the United States but the Great Recession had global economic ramifications, it would be interesting to investigate whether the trends can be observed within other countries.
